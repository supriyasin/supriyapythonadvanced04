    "#Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example \n",
    "   operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because \n",
    "   ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class. You might have noticed that the same built-in operator or \n",
    "   function shows different behavior for objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Python program to show use of\n",
    "   # + operator for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(1 + 2)\n",

    "   # Product two numbers\n",
    "   print(3 * 4)\n",

    "  Consider that we have two objects which are a physical representation of a class (user-defined data type) and we \n",
    "  have to add two objects with binary ‘+’ operator it throws an error, because compiler don’t know how to add two objects. \n",
    "  So we define a method for an operator and that process is called operator overloading. We can overload all existing \n",
    "  operators but we can’t create a new operator. To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function \n",
    "  or magic function that is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator. For example, when\n",
    "  we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Overloading binary + operator in Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "  When we use an operator on user-defined data types then automatically a special function or magic function associated \n",
    "  with that operator is invoked. Changing the behavior of operator is as simple as changing the behavior of a method \n",
    "  or function. You define methods in your class and operators work according to that behavior defined in methods. \n",
    "  When we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined. \n",
    "  Thereby changing this magic method’s code, we can give extra meaning to the + operator.\n",

    "  How Does the Operator Overloading Actually work?\n",

    "  Whenever you change the behavior of the existing operator through operator overloading, you have to redefine the \n",

    "   You might have wondered how the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for objects \n",

    "   will help you understand this mechanism, so that you can do the same in your own Python classes and make your \n",
    "   objects more Pythonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You’ll learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    . The API that handles operators and built-ins in Python\n",
    "    . The “secret” behind len() and other built-ins\n",
    "    . How to make your classes capable of using operators\n",
    "    . How to make your classes compatible with Python’s built-in functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "  As a bonus, you’ll also see an example class, objects of which will be compatible with many of these operators \n",
    "  and functions. Let’s get started!\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The Python Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "  Say you have a class representing an online order having a cart (a list) and a customer (a str or instance of another \n",
    "  class which represents a customer).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  In such a case, it is quite natural to want to obtain the length of the cart list. Someone new to Python might \n",
    "  decide to implement a method called get_cart_len() in their class to do this. But you can configure the built-in \n",
    "  len() in such a way that it returns the length of the cart list when given our object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In another case, we might want to append something to the cart. Again, someone new to Python would think of \n",
    "  implementing a method called append_to_cart() that takes an item and appends it to the cart list. But you can \n",
    "  configure the + operator in such a way that it appends a new item to the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Python does all this using special methods. These special methods have a naming convention, where the name starts \n",
    "  with two underscores, followed by an identifier and ends with another pair of underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Essentially, each built-in function or operator has a special method corresponding to it. For example, there’s __len__(), \n",
    "  corresponding to len(), and __add__(), corresponding to the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "  By default, most of the built-ins and operators will not work with objects of your classes. You must add the corresponding \n",
    "  special methods in your class definition to make your object compatible with built-ins and operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When you do this, the behavior of the function or operator associated with it changes according to that defined in the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is exactly what the Data Model (Section 3 of the Python documentation) helps you accomplish. It lists all the \n",
    "  special methods available and provides you with the means of overloading built-in functions and operators so that you \n",
    "  can use them on your own objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Let’s see what this means.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The Internals of Operations Like len() and []\n",
    "\n",
    "  Every class in Python defines its own behavior for built-in functions and methods. When you pass an instance of some \n",
    "  class to a built-in function or use an operator on the instance, it is actually equivalent to calling a special method \n",
    "  with relevant arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If there is a built-in function, func(), and the corresponding special method for the function is __func__(), Python \n",
    "  interprets a call to the function as obj.__func__(), where obj is the object. In the case of operators, if you have an \n",
    "  operator opr and the corresponding special method for it is __opr__(), Python interprets something like obj1 <opr> obj2 \n",
    "  as obj1.__opr__(obj2).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  So, when you’re calling len() on an object, Python handles the call as obj.__len__(). When you use the [] operator on an \n",
    "  iterable to obtain the value at an index, Python handles it as itr.__getitem__(index), where itr is the iterable object \n",
    "  and index is the index you want to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Therefore, when you define these special methods in your own class, you override the behavior of the function or operator \n",
    "  associated with them because, behind the scenes, Python is calling your method. Let’s get a better understanding of this:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >>> a = 'Real Python'\n",
    "  >>> b = ['Real', 'Python']\n",
    "  >>> len(a)\n",
    "  11\n",
    "  >>> a.__len__()\n",
    "  11\n",
    "  >>> b[0]\n",
    "  'Real'\n",
    "  >>> b.__getitem__(0)\n",
    "  'Real'\n",
    "\n",
    "  As you can see, when you use the function or its corresponding special method, you get the same result. In fact, when \n",
    "  you obtain the list of attributes and methods of a str object using dir(), you’ll see these special methods in the list \n",
    "  in addition to the usual methods available on str objects:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  >>> dir(a)\n",
    "['__add__',\n",
    " '__class__',\n",
    " '__contains__',\n",
    " '__delattr__',\n",
    " '__dir__',\n",
    " ...,\n",
    " '__iter__',\n",
    " '__le__',\n",
    " '__len__',\n",
    " '__lt__',\n",
    " ...,\n",
    " 'swapcase',\n",
    " 'title',\n",
    " 'translate',\n",
    " 'upper',\n",
    " 'zfill']\n",
    "\n",
    "  If the behavior of a built-in function or operator is not defined in the class by the special method, then you will \n",
    "  get a TypeError.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"I want to imitate a normal python list, except whenever elements are added or removed via slicing, I want to 'save' \n",
